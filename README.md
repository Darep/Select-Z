Selectionz
==========

Selectionz is a jQuery plugin for creating stylized dropdown, checkbox and
radio button elements. It hooks into the &lt;select&rt; elements you choose,
hides them and creates a bunch of HTML elements with descriptivie CSS classes,
so you can style them and create any look you want!

See [examples.html](https://rawgithub.com/solita/Selectionz/master/index.html)
for simple examples on how it works.

Support: IE7+, Chrome, Firefox and Opera.
